Don't be gullible:
Once upon a time, the Lion became hungry and he said to the fox: '𝗕𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗺𝗲 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗲𝗮𝘁, 𝗼𝗿 𝗜 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂.' The fox went to a donkey and said: '𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗟𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝗲.'
When the Lion saw the donkey, it attacked her, cutting off its ears, but the donkey managed to escape. The donkey said to the fox: '𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝗺𝗲! 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗟𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗺𝗲!'  The fox said: '𝗗𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘆! 𝗛𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘀, 𝘁𝗼 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗿𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗼𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗱! 𝗟𝗲𝘁'𝘀 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸.' It made sense to the donkey, so it went back.  The Lion attacked the donkey again, this time cutting off its tail! 
The donkey escaped again, saying to the fox: '𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝘄𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗹𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴! 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗟𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗼𝗳𝗳 𝗺𝘆 𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹!' The fox said: '𝗛𝗲 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹 𝘀𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝘀𝗶𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗳𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗲! 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝗲.' The fox convinced the donkey to return again. This time, the Lion caught the donkey and killed it. The Lion said to the fox: '𝗪𝗲𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗯𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗻𝗸𝗲𝘆. 𝗡𝗼𝘄, 𝗴𝗼, 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻 𝗶𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗯𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘀, 𝗹𝘂𝗻𝗴, 𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘁!'
The fox skinned the donkey and ate the donkey’s brain, but brought back its lung, liver, and heart to the Lion. The Lion became angry and asked: '𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻?!' The fox replied: '𝗜𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝗱 𝗻𝗼 𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘀, 𝗺𝘆 𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴. 𝗜𝗳 𝗶𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘀, 𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗮𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹.' The Lion said: '𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗲.'
